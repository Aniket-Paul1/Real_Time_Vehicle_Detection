## About the Project

This repository provides a lightweight, efficient pipeline for detecting vehicles in real-time from video feeds:

1. **Detection** â€“ Uses YOLOv8 (via a pre-trained `yolov8n.pt` model).  
2. **Analysis** â€“ Processes bounding boxes to count vehicles, log occurrences, and estimate traffic flow.  
3. **Integration** â€“ Outputs metrics to CSV, enabling further visualization or dashboard integration.

Perfect for traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and ITS enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Real-time object detection** of cars, motorcycles, buses, etc.  
- **Count & track** vehicles across frames using `sort.py`.  
- **Export statistics** to a CSV (`traffic_stats.csv`).  
- **Process local video files** (e.g., `simple.mp4`).

## Demo

See it in action:

```bash
python trafficAnalyzer.py --video simple.mp4 --output traffic_stats.csv
```
