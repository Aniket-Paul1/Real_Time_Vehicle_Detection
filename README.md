## About the Project

This repository provides a lightweight, efficient pipeline for detecting vehicles in real-time from video feeds:

1. **Detection** â€“ Uses YOLOv8 (via a pre-trained `yolov8n.pt` model).
2. **Analysis** â€“ Processes bounding boxes to count vehicles, log occurrences, and estimate traffic flow.
3. **Integration** â€“ Outputs metrics to CSV, enabling further visualization or dashboard integration.

Perfect for traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and ITS enthusiasts.

---

## Features

- **Real-time object detection** of cars, motorcycles, buses, etc.  
- **Count & track** vehicles across frames using `sort.py`.  
- **Export statistics** to a CSV (`traffic_stats.csv`).  
- **Process local video files** (e.g., `simple.mp4`).  

---

## Demo

See it in action:

bash
python trafficAnalyzer.py --video simple.mp4 --output traffic_stats.csv
This runs detection, tracks vehicles, and saves stats to CSV.

Installation
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Aniket-Paul1/Real_Time_Vehicle_Detection.git
cd Real_Time_Vehicle_Detection
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt isn't provided, the key Python packages are:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install ultralytics opencv-python scipy pandas sort-tracker
Download the YOLOv8 model
The repo already includes a lightweight yolov8n.pt model for detection.

Usage
Detect from a video file
bash
Copy
Edit
python trafficAnalyzer.py \
  --video simple.mp4 \
  --weights yolov8n.pt \
  --output traffic_stats.csv \
  --show
--show: display detection in a real-time window (optional).

Output metrics (e.g., frame count, total vehicles) saved to CSV.

Customize tracking
Use sort.py directly if you want to integrate the SORT tracker in your own application.
